<h3>My hobbies and interests are...</h3>
<p>
	My interests revolve mostly around my passion for reading and gaming. At the time of writing I am in the middle of reading the Dark Imperium trilogy by Guy Haley. I am also an avid Super Smash Brothers Melee player,
	with Ganondorf being my main. Hopefully, I will one day achieve a Power Ranking in the Irish tier list.

<h3>If you knew you couldn't fail, what would you do? </h3>
<p>
	Firstly I would start playing the stock market to gain an unpresedented wealth. Next I would use this aquired money to do enough good in the world, so I can gain an imaculate reputation. With all the extra money I make, I would
	short X, Tesla and SpaceX to put them out of business. Once I have done this, I will then become the next spaceman and create a company that would be successful in terraforming Mars. While I am doing all of this, I would use my inability
	to fail to become the best e-sports player ever, entering numerous events and placing 1st in every single one.

	<p>
		The purpose of theis site is to be a sort of pseudo library for at the very least some of my extra carricular activities and hobbies.
