          <h3>What is a Slice of PY </h3>
          <p>
                  My Slice of PY is an introductory Python class designed specifically for post-Junior Certificate students, making coding both fun and accessible. Whether students have prior experience with programming or are complete beginners, this course provides an easy-to-follow introduction to one of the world's most widely used programming languages.
                  <br>
                  The course introduces learners to the exciting possibilities of Python through interactive lessons, hands-on projects, and engaging challenges. It takes a "vertical slice" approach, meaning students get a well-rounded introduction to different aspects of Python, rather than focusing on just one area. From creating simple games and interactive applications to automating everyday tasks, students gain practical coding skills that can be applied in real-world scenarios.
                  <br>
                  With a strong emphasis on creativity and problem-solving, My Slice of PY fosters a supportive and enjoyable learning environment. The curriculum is designed to keep students engaged by incorporating fun coding exercises, real-life examples, and collaborative activities that encourage experimentation. Instead of just memorizing syntax, students learn how to think like programmersâ€”breaking problems down, writing efficient code, and troubleshooting errors effectively.
                  <br>
                  Beyond just learning to code, this course helps students develop essential skills for the future, including logical thinking, attention to detail, and perseverance. Whether they aim to pursue a career in technology, enhance their problem-solving abilities, or simply explore a new hobby, My Slice of PY provides a strong foundation in programming. By the end of the course, students will have gained confidence in their coding abilities and an appreciation for the creative potential of Python.

          <h3>Did you enjoy using Python? Please explain your answer. </h3>
          <p>
              I did enjoy using python. I see learning python as a skill that I will keep using for the rest of my life, especially if I continue down the path of an IT realated job.

          <h3> What did you find hard in Python? </h3>
          <p>
              There was nothing I found quite hard in the python. I would be as bold to say that I have taken to python like a penguin to air and a chicken to water.

          <h3>Were there any programs you found particularly interesting? </h3>
          <p>
              I found all programs interesting. When it comes to learning about computers, there is hardly anything that I would find particularly boring.
